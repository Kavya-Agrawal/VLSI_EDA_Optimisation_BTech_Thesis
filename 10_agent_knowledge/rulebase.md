# Rulebase (self-evolving)

The planner may add, relax or tighten rules here after each iteration. Keep rules short and testable.
Rules marked [fixed] are safety constraints and cannot be removed by agents.

## Safety [fixed]
- Only files under the candidate `rsz/` tree may be edited. Never touch OpenSTA, odb, dbSta or other modules.
- The resizer must keep the design logically equivalent: no change to the netlist function, only sizing,
  buffering (insert/remove), cloning, pin swapping on commutative pins and VT swaps.
- Any move must keep the placement legalizable (`detailed_placement` must succeed) and must not create DRV
  violations beyond the reference.
- No non-determinism: no unordered iteration over pointer-keyed containers that changes results, no
  wall-clock-dependent decisions, no threads whose scheduling changes the outcome.
- Do not spend the iteration on runtime micro-optimisation or data-structure refactoring; the objective is
  WNS/TNS after `repair_timing`, judged by the evaluator.

## Method
- One hypothesis per iteration, written down before coding: problem -> current heuristic -> new approach ->
  why WNS/TNS should improve -> risks -> how we will see it in the path report.
- Prefer changes to *what* the algorithm decides (ordering, selection, acceptance, search strategy, cost
  model) over changes to *how fast* it does it.
- Read the evaluator's worst-path attribution before choosing a cluster; attack the dominant cause.
